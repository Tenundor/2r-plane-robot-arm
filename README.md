Exercise 6.1 
from the book "MODERN ROBOTICS MECHANICS, PLANNING, AND CONTROL" Kevin M. Lynch and Frank C. Park

Write a program that solves the analytical inverse kinematics
for a planar 3R robot with link lengths L1 = 3, L2 = 2, and L3 = 1, given the
desired position (x, y) and orientation θ of a frame fixed to the tip of the robot.
Each joint has no joint limits. Your program should find all the solutions (how
many are there in the general case?), give the joint angles for each, and draw the
robot in these configurations. Test the code for the case of (x, y, θ) = (4, 2, 0).
